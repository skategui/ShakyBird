# ShakyBird

Shaky bird is one of the first game where your only way to control the game is â€¦ to shake your phone !
Following the same concept of flappy bird, you play the role of a little bird which needs to jump over pipes.

Seems trivial ?

Would you be able to stay concentrated after shaking your phone and defy the inversion of gravity ?

Now, It is your turn to play !


# Game

Shake your phone to make the bird jump
Be careful : more point you have, more difficult it is : The pipes become bigger and bigger and...
you might have some issues with the gravity as well.

In case it is too easy for you ! :)
